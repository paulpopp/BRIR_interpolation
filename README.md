# BRIR_interpolation

This project aims to interpolate between measured BRIRs and save these in a format which [pyBinSim](https://github.com/pyBinSim/pyBinSim) can read.

**!!ATTENTION!!**  
The private branch ``ConvolverMultisourceMat`` of pyBinSim is required to use the generated BRIRs.

## Acknowledgment  

The main part for the BRIR interpolation is taken from the repo [Music Player for Binaural Spatialization](https://github.com/gdalsanto/music-player-for-binaural-spatialization).  
Thanks a lot to Gloria Dal Santo!
